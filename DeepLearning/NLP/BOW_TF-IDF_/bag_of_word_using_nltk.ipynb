    "paragraph = \"\"\"Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (born June 21, 1985), known professionally as Lana Del Rey, is an American singer-songwriter. Her music is noted for its melancholy exploration of glamor and romance, with frequent references to pop culture and 1950s–1970s Americana.[2] She is the recipient of various accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award, three MTV Europe Music Awards, two Brit Awards, two Billboard Women in Music awards and a Satellite Award, in addition to nominations for eleven Grammy Awards and a Golden Globe Award.[3] Variety honored her at their Hitmakers Awards for being \"one of the most influential singer-songwriters of the 21st century\". In 2023, Rolling Stone placed Del Rey on their list of the \"200 Greatest Singers of All Time\", while their sister publication Rolling Stone UK named her as the \"Greatest American Songwriter of the 21st century\".[4][5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Raised in upstate New York, Del Rey moved to New York City in 2005 to pursue a music career. After numerous projects, including her self-titled debut studio album (2010), Del Rey's breakthrough came in 2011 with the viral success of her single \"Video Games\"; she subsequently signed a recording contract with Polydor and Interscope.[6] She achieved critical and commercial success with her second album, Born to Die (2012), which featured a moody, hip hop-inflected sound and contained the sleeper hit \"Summertime Sadness\". Born To Die became her first of six number-one albums in the UK, and also topped various national charts around the world. Del Rey's third album, Ultraviolence (2014), featured greater use of guitar-driven instrumentation and debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200. Her fourth and fifth albums, Honeymoon (2015) and Lust for Life (2017), saw a return to the stylistic traditions of her earlier releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her critically acclaimed sixth album, Norman Fucking Rockwell! (2019), explored soft rock and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards; it was later included on the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" published by Rolling Stone.[7][8] Her next studio albums, Chemtrails over the Country Club and Blue Banisters, followed in 2021 and explored Americana. Del Rey collaborated with Taylor Swift on \"Snow on the Beach\" from Swift's tenth studio album Midnights (2022);[9] the song appeared at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, marking Del Rey's highest position on the chart. Del Rey's ninth studio album, Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, was later released in 2023, supported by its title track[10] and the critically acclaimed single \"A&W\", with the latter being named one of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" by Rolling Stone.[11] Later that year, she released the Billboard Global 200 top-20 hit \"Say Yes to Heaven\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Del Rey has collaborated on soundtracks for visual media; in 2013, she wrote and starred in the critically acclaimed musical short Tropico[12] and released \"Young and Beautiful\" for the romantic drama The Great Gatsby, which was highly praised by critics and received Grammy Award and Critics' Choice Award nominations. In 2014, she recorded \"Once Upon a Dream\" for the dark fantasy adventure film Maleficent and the titular theme song for the biopic Big Eyes, which was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.[13][14] Del Rey also recorded the collaboration \"Don't Call Me Angel\" for the action comedy Charlie's Angels (2019). Del Rey published the poetry and photography collection Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass (2020). \"\"\""
